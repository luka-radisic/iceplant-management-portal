# Test Data Protocol for Company Management Portal

---

## 1. Overview

This protocol defines best practices for creating, managing, and maintaining test data across all modules (except Attendance) in the Company Management Portal. It ensures realistic, consistent, and safe test data for development, testing, and staging environments.

---

## 2. Principles

- **Realism:** Test data should reflect actual business scenarios for ice plants, metal/steel fabrication, hardware stores, and company operations.
- **Coverage:** Include data for buyers, inventory, sales, maintenance, expenses, and other modules.
- **Compliance:** Populate all required fields to avoid integrity errors.
- **Isolation:** Avoid sensitive or production data in test environments.
- **Repeatability:** Scripts should be idempotent or resettable.
- **Documentation:** Clearly document assumptions and data generation logic.

## 3. Test Data Guidelines

### Buyers
- Include diverse customer types: retail, wholesale, corporate.
- Cover ice delivery clients, hardware customers, metal fabrication clients.
- Populate required fields: `name`.
- Optionally include: `email`, `phone`, `address`, `company_name`, `tax_id`, `business_type`.

### Inventory
- Include ice products, steel materials, hardware items, consumables.
- Populate required fields: `item_name`, `quantity`.
- Use realistic quantities and units.
- Set `minimum_level` to trigger low stock alerts for some items.

### Sales
- Link to existing buyers.
- Populate required fields: `buyer_name`, `status` (default `'processed'`), `si_number` (can be autogenerated or dummy).
- Include multiple sale items per sale.
- Use realistic quantities and prices.

### Sale Items
- Link to existing inventory items.
- Populate required fields: `quantity`, `unit_price`.
- `total_price` should be auto-calculated.

### Maintenance
- Include assets like ice machines, forklifts, trucks, AC units, construction equipment.
- Populate required fields: `name` for `MaintenanceItem`.
- Add maintenance records with realistic descriptions and statuses.

### Expenses, Suppliers, Others
- Use realistic vendor names, categories, and amounts.
- Cover typical operational costs.

## 4. Data Management Best Practices

- **Use management commands** or fixtures for data loading.
- **Avoid hardcoding IDs**; use lookups or create related objects dynamically.
- **Reset test data** regularly to avoid stale or inconsistent states.
- **Version control** test data scripts and fixtures.
- **Document** any assumptions or special cases in the data.

---

## 5. Updating Test Data

- Update test data scripts whenever models change (new required fields, relations).
- Review and test data loading after migrations.
- Keep this protocol updated with new business domains or modules.

---

## 6. Compliance Checklist

- [ ] All required fields populated
- [ ] Realistic values used
- [ ] Covers all business domains
- [ ] No sensitive/production data
- [ ] Scripts/fixtures tested and versioned
- [ ] Documentation updated

## 7. Summary

Following this protocol ensures high-quality, realistic, and maintainable test data, improving development speed, testing accuracy, and deployment safety.

# Access Control & API Communication Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to resolve issues with API communication, group management, and permission-based UI rendering in the Iceplant Management Portal. These changes ensure that the administrator user has full access to all system features without requiring page refreshes.

## Problems Fixed

### 1. API Communication Issues

**Problem:** 
- Frontend components were making API requests to `http://localhost:5173/api/...` (the frontend dev server) instead of `http://localhost:8000/api/...` (the backend server)
- This resulted in 404 and 500 errors when trying to access API endpoints

**Solution:**
- Updated the `apiClient.ts` configuration to use the correct backend URL from environment variables
- Modified components to consistently use the apiClient instead of directly using axios
- Added proper error handling and fallback data for API requests

### 2. Authentication & Navigation Refresh Issues

**Problem:**
- Admin UI elements (like Group Management, Company Settings) were not showing up immediately after login
- Users had to manually refresh the page to see all navigation options they had access to

**Solution:**
- Added an event-based system to force navigation updates when authentication state changes
- Implemented a custom 'auth-change' event that's dispatched after successful login
- Added an event listener in DashboardLayout to respond to authentication changes

### 3. Group Management Data Loading

**Problem:**
- Group Management page wasn't loading data from the backend
- API requests were failing due to incorrect URL configurations
- TypeError was occurring when processing module mapping data

**Solution:**
- Fixed all API calls in the GroupManagementPage component to use the correct client and endpoints
- Added null/undefined checks before processing API response data
- Implemented fallback data for when API calls fail

## Detailed Changes

### 1. apiClient.ts
- Updated the base URL configuration to use the backend URL from environment variables
- Ensured proper token authentication for all API requests

### 2. AuthContext.tsx
- Added an event dispatch mechanism to notify components of authentication changes
- Improved error handling and data normalization

### 3. DashboardLayout.tsx
- Added an event listener for 'auth-change' events
- Implemented a force update mechanism to refresh navigation options

### 4. GroupManagementPage.tsx
- Fixed all API calls to use the apiClient with correct endpoints
- Added better error handling and data validation
- Fixed CRUD operations for creating, updating, and deleting groups

### 5. MaintenanceDashboard.tsx
- Updated API calls to use the correct client and endpoints
- Improved error handling and response data processing

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Login Flow:**
   - Login as administrator
   - Verify that all admin options appear immediately without requiring a page refresh

2. **Group Management:**
   - Access the Group Management page
   - Verify that existing groups are displayed correctly
   - Test creating, updating, and deleting groups

3. **Permission-Based Access:**
   - Verify that the administrator user can access all modules
   - Test navigation between different modules without permission errors

## Conclusion

These fixes address the core issues with API communication and permission-based UI rendering in the application. By consistently using the apiClient with proper URL configuration and implementing event-based UI updates, we've ensured that the administrator user has a seamless experience accessing all system features.

## Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive API Error Handling:**
   - Consider implementing centralized error handling for API requests
   - Add retry mechanisms for intermittent connection issues

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Review API data caching opportunities
   - Implement pagination for large data sets

3. **User Experience Enhancements:**
   - Add loading indicators for all API operations
   - Improve error messages with specific recovery actions

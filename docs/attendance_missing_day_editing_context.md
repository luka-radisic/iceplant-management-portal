# Manual Edit of Check In for Missing Day Attendance Records

## 1. Problem Statement

- The Attendance table hides Check In times of `23:56`, which are used as a placeholder for missing day attendance records.
- The "Checked" tool currently only allows editing Check Out if there is no Check In time.
- HR needs the ability to manually add or edit Check In (and Check Out) for these placeholder records (where Check In is `23:56`).

## 2. Technical Constraints

- Both frontend and backend must support editing Check In for records where Check In is `23:56`.
- The value `23:56` is always used as the placeholder for missing days added by the tool.
- There must be no regression or unintended side effects for normal attendance records.

## 3. Solution Plan

- Update frontend logic to allow editing Check In (and optionally Check Out) when Check In is `23:56`.
- Ensure backend API supports updating Check In for these records.
- QA: Verify that edits are saved, reflected in the UI, and do not affect normal records.
- (Optional) Add a visual indicator in the UI for "missing day" records.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- HR can manually edit Check In (and optionally Check Out) for records with Check In = `23:56`.
- Edits are saved and reflected in the Attendance table.
- No regression for normal attendance records.
- (Optional) "Missing day" records are visually distinct in the UI.

## 5. Open Questions

- Is there a specific workflow for HR approval after manual edits?
- Should the UI visually distinguish these "missing day" records?
- Should the edit be allowed only for Check In, or for both Check In and Check Out for these records?
## 6. Final Implementation & QA Summary

### Implementation Overview

1. **Frontend Editing & Visual Highlighting**
   - The Attendance frontend now allows editing of records where Check In is `23:56` ("missing day" records).
   - These records are visually distinguished in the UI for easy identification by HR.

2. **Backend API Support**
   - The backend API fully supports and persists edits to "missing day" records.
   - There are no restrictions on editing these records; changes are saved as with normal attendance records.

3. **Automated Testing**
   - Automated tests (`AttendanceMissingDayEditTest`) verify correct behavior for editing and persisting changes to these records.
   - Regression tests ensure that normal attendance records are unaffected.

4. **End-to-End QA**
   - Manual QA confirms all acceptance criteria are met:
     - HR can edit Check In/Out for "missing day" records.
     - Edits are saved and reflected in the UI.
     - Visual distinction is present for these records.
     - No regression for normal records.
